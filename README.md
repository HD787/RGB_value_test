This fairly simple SDL script is used in a variety of projects generally for the purpose of displaying things to the screen in some manner, whether it be just to test things like the TGA parser or to display frames from the graphics pipeline implementation I did.

I often like to do things from scratch however interacting with operating system APIs is not super inline with my interests, I do plan on exploring this someday but for now just using SDL for windowing and input gathering is convenient and allows me to iterate faster and not have to worry about the platform I'm using.
